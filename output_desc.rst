PyParse Outputs
===============


Introduction
-------------

PyParse generates multiple tables and visualisations as part of the analysis. These allow the user to 
draw conclusions as to the success or otherwise of the reaction. It also provides a standard layout for upload
of the processed data for long term storage, searching, and machine learning.

The visualisations and logs are formatted into an easy-to-use HTML format. All data is also wrapped up into a zip file 
for each of file sharing. 



Heatmap
--------

The heatmap is coloured using the plot_type (-pt parameter) specified, and is generated using matplotlib.

Trellised Pie-Charts
-------------------------

A pie chart visualisation is also generated; each pie is sized according to the plot_type parameter, 
and the size of each wedge corresponds to the LCMS UV percentage area of the peak corresponding to that compound.

Hit Validation Graph
----------------------

This graph visualises *all possible peaks* that contain a m/z which correspond to that expected for that compound,
across the entire plate. 

It is designed to help spot trends across the plate and to point out to the user other possibilities which were ultimately 
discounted by the hit validation algorithm in PyParse. 

.. tip:: 

	This graph can be particularly helpful for quicking spotting plate where more than one regioisomer
	has been synthesised.
	
* One hit validation graph is generated per compound
* All hits (peaks which contain the desired m/z) are plotted by their retention time vs the well in which they were observed.
* Hits coloured in black are those which were used to generate the heatmap, pie-charts and other outputs
* Hits coloured in red are those which were discarded by the hit validation algorithm. 
* Hits are shaped by the cluster to which they were assigned during validation.

.. important::

	A successful validation will produce a straight line of points in black, i.e. each peak used in the analysis 
	had the same retention time. 
	
	
In the HTML output, the logs that are pertinant to that compound are provided with the hit validation graph. 
Read through these logs to discover more about the hits that PyParse included, discarded, or marked as a "tentative" 
assignment due to their UV absorbance or m/z intensity deviating from what was the norm for that compound.
